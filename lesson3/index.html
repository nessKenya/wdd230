      <h2>PURPOSE</h2>
      <div>
        <p>The main purpose of Mombasa Chamber of Commerce is to provide services for accessing, using, or participating in the Internet by linking the local service providers with the current market.</p>
        <p> In promoting the growth and development of internet businesses, our focus is on commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned service providers as well as the targetted audience. The chamber will provide different membership ranging from free to the most expensive package based on accessible services.</p>
        <p>Finally, we aim to improve The Internet Service Providers perception among the consumers by responding to their dissatisfaction, concerns, questions and challenges. Additionally, we shall offer ratings for the service providers to help the consumers make informed decisions on which local service provider to use. Also, we shall address the challenges facing the Mombasa ISPs by offering them wide range trainings by inviting Nationally known Internet Experts.</p>

          Cusines is what makes places unique. When you visit a town, you find houses built uniquely, streets decorated 
          in ways that express what the people believe. However, what makes everything special is the taste of food 
          and drinks. There are amazing traditionally designed hotels such as Forodhani and Ambalala, where, you enjoy
          the local cuisine while feeling the sea breeze and possibly surfing the internet. Can you imagine calling family 
          to show them your newly done on your bucketlist and they find out it is something they have never heard of?

          Mombasa is booming with both small scale businesses as well as medium sized businesses. The local government
          known as the County Government of Mombasa has created enabling
          environment that helps the SMEs to operate in a good environment. A reliable ISP with proper training will 
          come in handy to these business people as they try to explore more potential markets.

          Mombasa Port is the largest port in East and Central Africa. The position coupled with improved
          means of transport that includes air, train and road makes the movement of goods faster. Unfortunately,
          one of the headaches of freight and logistics company is ensuring that their entered data is easily synced so that
          their clients wherever they are, they are aware of the activities happening. This creates a massive opportunity 
          for improved and reliable ISP.

          Sports has a large role in any society. Sports can be for merely competition for silverware or it can be
          an opportunity to unwind from work and other engagement and at the same time it can be used for team building.
          No matter the type or aim of the sport, one thing remains important, communication. The communication 
          can be News Reporters providing news back to their editors which needs to be done fast. It can also be team leaders
          reporting the progress of team building. ISPs need to capitalize on this opportunity.

          According to the latest government demography and statistics, Mombasa has 610,257 males and 598,046
          females. This shows that the number of men is higher than women, which was a little startling. A good 
          percentage of these population are working and raising children. Internet has changed education 
          massively. Today, assignments are done and submitted online.

          One of the world's fears is drop in population overtime. However, this hasn't been same application with 
          Mombasa. Mombasa population according to Census has been on the rise. A higher population with many demanding 
          good and reliable needs ISPs to listen and improve on their services. The population clearly is an indicator of untapped 
          opportunity by the ISP.
